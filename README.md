A world model is a model that can predict the next state of the world given the observed previous states and actions.

World models are essential to training all kinds of intelligent agents, especially self-driving models.

commaVQ contains:
- encoder/decoder models used to heavily compress driving scenes
- a world model trained on 3,000,000 minutes of driving videos
- a dataset of 100,000 minutes of compressed driving videos

# Task

## Lossless compression challenge: make me smaller! $500 challenge
Losslessly compress 5,000 minutes of driving video "tokens". Go to [./compression/](./compression/) to start

**Prize: highest compression rate on 5,000 minutes of driving video (~915MB) - Challenge ends July, 1st 2024 11:59pm AOE**

Submit a single zip file containing the compressed data and a python script to decompress it into its original form. Top solutions will be listed [comma's official leaderboard](https://comma.ai/leaderboard).

## Overview
A VQ-VAE [1,2] was used to heavily compress each video frame into 128 "tokens" of 10 bits each. Each entry of the dataset is a "segment" of compressed driving video, i.e. 1min of frames at 20 FPS. Each file is of shape 1200x8x16 and saved as int16.

A world model [3] was trained to predict the next token given a context of past tokens. This world model is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) [4] trained on 3,000,000 minutes of driving videos following a similar recipe to [5].
