A world model is a model that can predict the next state of the world given the observed previous states and actions.

World models are essential to training all kinds of AI agents, especially self-driving models.

commaVQ contains:
- encoder/decoder models used to heavily compress driving scenes
- a world model trained on 3,000,000 minutes of driving videos
- a dataset of 100,000 minutes of compressed driving videos

## Overview
A VQ-VAE [1,2] was used to heavily compress each video frame into 128 "tokens" of 10 bits each. Each entry of the dataset is a "segment" of compressed driving video, i.e. 1min of frames at 20 FPS. Each file is of shape 1200x8x16 and saved as int16.

A world model [3] was trained to predict the next token given a context of past tokens. This world model is a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) [4] trained on 3,000,000 minutes of driving videos following a similar recipe to [5].

## Examples
[./notebooks/encode.ipynb](./notebooks/encode.ipynb) and [./notebooks/decode.ipynb](./notebooks/decode.ipynb) for an example of how to visualize the dataset using a segment of driving video from [comma's drive to Taco Bell](https://blog.comma.ai/taco-bell/)

[./notebooks/gpt.ipynb](./notebooks/gpt.ipynb) for an example of how to use the world model to imagine future frames.

[./notebooks/compress.ipynb](./notebooks/compress.ipynb) for an example of how we would like to temporally compress the tokens of each segment
